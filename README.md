# DHT11_ESP32
The project is mainly about reading the ambient temperature and humidity using a DHT11 sensor and an ESP32
Pin Configuration:
+ The + or VCC is connected to the 3V3 or 3.3V pin of the ESP32
- The - or ground is connected to the GND pin of the ESP32
The midle pin or data pin is connected the GPIO4 of the ESP32
The DHT sensor library for ESPx by Bernd Giesecke is required
